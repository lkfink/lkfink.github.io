## Code for personal website (https://lkfink.github.io)

This repository contains all code required to generate my [personal website](https://lkfink.github.io/). 

I was inspired to create a website on Github by [Brian Hurley](https://github.com/bkhurley). Most of the code was adapted from [Karl Broman's](https://github.com/kbroman) personal git website and great tutorials.
