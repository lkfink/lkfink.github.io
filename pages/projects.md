### <a name="Modeling attention"></a>Modeling attention to music
In this project, Lauren uses a combination of computational modeling, psychophysics, eye-tracking, and electroencephalography (EEG) to measure and predict dynamic attention to auditory stimuli. Specifically, she aims to 1) assess the potential of a stimulus-driven [linear oscillator model](http://atonal.ucdavis.edu/projects/musical_spaces/rhythm/btb/){:target="_blank"} to predict attention to complex musical stimuli and 2) determine the relationship between ocular and cortical responses to auditory rhythms and whether pupil dynamics can index auditory attention in a manner similar to EEG signatures.

### <a name="GEM"></a>Groove Enhancement Machine (GEM)
This project involves a real-time adaptive music making device to enhance synchrony between groups of people tapping together. Lauren is in the process of writing up the results of this project. All code and hardware specifications will eventually be publicly available. Check back in a few months for more details. 

[This short documentary, directed by Joerg Altekruse, highlights an early prototype of the project.](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/074208-005-A/groove-maschine/){:target="_blank"}

### <a name="Mobile eye-tracking"></a>Mobile eye-tracking

Lauren is currently using [Pupil Labs'](https://pupil-labs.com/){:target="_blank"} mobile eye-tracking headsets in a variety of music/neuroscience projects. More details coming soon. For anyone considering purchasing from Pupil Labs, Lauren has written up a [short guide of considerations](http://lkfink.github.io/pages/PupilLabs_aBeginnersGuide.html){:target="_blank"}.

### <a name="WAC"></a>Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC)
Lauren served for three years as the lead Graduate Writing Fellow in the University of California Davis's Writing Across the Curriculum program. In this role, she managed a team of six Graduate Writing Fellows and acted as a liason between graduate fellows and faculty. The WAC fellows hold one-on-one [writing consultations](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/consultations){:target="_blank"} with graduate students and postdocs from any discipline, offer writing [retreats](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/retreats){:target="_blank"} and [workshops](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/workshops){:target="_blank"}, as well as specialized programs such as the [Graduate Certificate in Writing Theory and Practice](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/certificate){:target="_blank"} and the [Writing Partner Program](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/resources/writing-partner-program){:target="_blank"}. Lauren developed the curriculum for the Graduate Certificate in Writing Theory and Practice, along with WAC peers [Tori White and Julia Ribeiro](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/gfw-bios){:target="_blank"}. She also conducted numerous research projects which were presented at the following conferences:
