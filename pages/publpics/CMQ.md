During the pandemic, we wanted to understand the role of music in helping people to cope with the crisis. We found that:   

> During the COVID-19 lockdown, people turned to music for regulating their emotions.  

> People experiencing different degrees of emotional changes showed different patterns of musical engagement.  

> Listening to music vs. making music may provide different coping potentials.  

> "Coronamusic" played a key role in socio-emotional coping.
