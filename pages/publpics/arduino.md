We are currently using [Arduino Unos](https://www.arduino.cc/) with [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) waveshields (for playing sound) in group music-making experiments in the lab. The over-arching question is whether we can enhance the motor synchrony of groups of people tapping together by adapting in real-time to the performance. The answers seems to be yes! And that enhanced motor synchrony also corresponds to higher ratings of enjoyment from participants.    

You can watch a short video, with preliminary data, about the project here:
