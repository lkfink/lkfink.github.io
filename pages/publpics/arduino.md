We are currently using [Arduino Unos](https://www.arduino.cc/){:target="_blank"} with [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/){:target="_blank"} waveshields (for playing sound) in group music-making experiments in the lab. The over-arching question is whether we can enhance the motor synchrony of groups of people tapping together by adapting in real-time to their performance.   
The answer seems to be yes!  Also, it seems enhanced motor synchrony leads to higher ratings of enjoyment from participants.    

This paper is currently under review and will be published soon.   
[All code for the project is publicly available](https://github.com/janatalab/GEM){:target="_blank"}.
