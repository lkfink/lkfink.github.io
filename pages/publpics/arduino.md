## An assistive group music-making device! 
We are currently using [Arduino Unos](https://www.arduino.cc/){:target="_blank"} with [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/){:target="_blank"} waveshields (for playing sound) in group music-making experiments in the lab. The over-arching question is: **can enhance the motor synchrony of groups of people tapping together by adapting in real-time to their performance?** The answer is yes!  Also, this enhanced motor synchrony leads to higher ratings of enjoyment from participants.
