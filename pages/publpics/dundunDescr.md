In this project, we ask what it is that distinguishes speech from music. Every day, we easily tell the difference between these two types of auditory stimuli, but which acoustic features are important? 
And what about when speech and music are produced by the same instrument? We are used to distinguishing singing vs. speaking with the human voice, but did you know there are also drums that can "speak"? 
We ask people both familiar and unfamiliar with the talking drum to classify its performances into speech or music. It turns out even those unfamiliar with the language of the drum could do so above chance. But how?
