#### Predicting sensorimotor synchronization and attention to music using a linear oscillator model, eye-tracking, and electroencephalography

Supervised by [Petr Janata](https://atonal.ucdavis.edu/people/){:target="_blank"} 

#### ABSTRACT
Rhythm is a ubiquitous feature of music that induces specific neural modes of processing. In the following studies, we employ a computational model to predict fluctuations in attention as a function of temporal structure. We test our predictions against behavioral indices of attention, namely perceptual thresholds (Chs. 2 & 3) and subjective reports (Ch 4), as well as neural markers of attention – changes in pupil size (Chs. 2-4) and cortical activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG; Ch 3). Chapter 1 highlights key theories regarding the cognitive and neurophysiological underpinnings of changes in pupil size to situate a discussion of the pupillary response to sound in future chapters. Chapters 2 and 3 detail the results of variations on an adaptive thresholding experiment in which participants detect deviants embedded into rhythmic patterns at multiple temporal locations. In both intensity increment (Ch 2) and decrement (Ch 3) versions of the experiment, we observed 1) perceptual thresholds vary as a function of output from the computational model, 2) a pupil dilation response to detected and missed (below perceptual threshold) deviants, with evoked pupil amplitude predicting participants’ responses. Chapter 3 discusses preliminary EEG results and the relationship between pupillary and cortical indices of auditory attention. In chapters 2 and 3 we also analyze the continuous pupillary response to the various rhythmic patterns and show entrainment to predicted prominent periodicities, as well as coherence between the pupil signal and the modelled temporal salience predictions. We extend these findings in Chapter 4, showing pupillary entrainment to complex, ‘real-world’ music that is predicted by participants’ absorption and familiarity ratings. We conclude that the model is relevant in predicting the temporal salience of complex stimuli and that the continuous pupillary signal can reveal psychologically relevant, fine-grained information about an attended auditory stimulus.

#### Music modulates eyeblinks: An examination of temporal coordination

Supervised by [Ian Cross](http://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/directory/ian-cross){:target="_blank"} 

##### Abstract: 
Eyeblinks have yet to attract significant attention in music cognition research, though they have been studied extensively in other domains. Rather than an artifact to be removed in eye tracking or EEG data, eyeblinks, and their connection with musical behaviors, warrant proper exploration.

**Background:** Eyeblinks tend to occur at structurally salient breaks during both reading and speech; they are likely to occur at the ends of sentences and paragraphs in a text, or at pauses and turns in speech (Orchard & Stern, 1991; Cummins, 2012). Interestingly, blinks are often synchronized, or temporally coordinated, between speakers (Nakano & Kitazawa, 2010); however, individuals with autism spectrum disorders fail to show such synchrony, perhaps indicating that temporal coordination is at the root of social communication impairments (Nakano et al., 2011).

Further, eyeblinks can be read as indicators of a variety of psychological and clinical states (Oh et al., 2012). Mirroring attention/arousal and modulated by dopamine (DA), eyeblinks reveal information about sleepiness, attentiveness, and the difficulty of a task (Ponder & Kennedy, 1927; Schleicher et al., 2008). Blink rate (BR) is directly proportional to DA levels, with Parkinson’s patients (low DA/low BR) and schizophrenics (high DA/high BR) at opposite ends of the dopamine/blinking spectrum (Barbato et al., 2012; Colzato et al., 2009; Esteban et al., 2004). Such dopamine-linked disorders typically involve disruptions in timing and/or motor processes, mediated by brainstem structures like the basal ganglia and cerebellum.
Eyeblink analysis is an established neuropsychological tool – used to evaluate dopamine function, cognitive load, and both temporal and social coordination. Such analysis can reasonably be expected to be relevant in the scientific study of music.

**Present Aims:** Because eyeblinks have clear social and clinical implications, the goal of this thesis is to examine the role eyeblinks might play in music cognition and to discuss the results of a sight- reading experiment conducted at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam. Results of the experiment suggest that, in general, eyeblinks are suppressed while sight-reading; however, blinks that do occur tend to be at musical phrase transitions or at other structurally relevant musical instances. While there is variability across participants in average number of blinks per reading, there is an incredible amount of consistency on an individual basis in average number of blinks, as well as musical/temporal location of blinks across readings. Overall, it seems that eyeblinks provide insights into an individual’s chunking of musical information and are likely to be a particularly useful evaluative tool in pedagogical and/or therapeutic settings, in addition to experimental ones.
