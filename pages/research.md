### <a name="Modeling attention"></a>Modeling attention to music
In this project, I use a combination of computational modeling, psychophysics, eye-tracking, and electroencephalography (EEG) to measure and predict dynamic attention to auditory stimuli. Specifically, I aim to 1) assess the potential of a stimulus-driven [linear oscillator model](http://atonal.ucdavis.edu/projects/musical_spaces/rhythm/btb/){:target="_blank"} to predict attention to complex musical stimuli and 2) determine the relationship between ocular and cortical responses to auditory rhythms and whether pupil dynamics can index auditory attention in a manner similar to EEG signatures.

This video shows oscillations in pupil size while listening to a clip of music. The video is sped up 5x.

### <a name="GEM"></a>Groove Enhancement Machine (GEM)
This project involves a real-time adaptive music making device to enhance motor synchrony and subjective enjoyment between groups of people tapping together. Our paper about this project is published in [Frontiers in Human Neuroscience](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.916551){:target="_blank"}. All code and hardware specifications required to build the device are publicly available.

This short documentary, directed by Joerg Altekruse, highlights an early prototype of the project, as well as related work in the Janata Lab.

### <a name="Mobile eye-tracking"></a>Mobile eye-tracking

I am currently using [Pupil Labs'](https://pupil-labs.com/){:target="_blank"} mobile eye-tracking glasses in a variety of music/neuroscience projects. <!-- For anyone considering purchasing from Pupil Labs, I previously wrote up a [short guide of considerations](http://lkfink.github.io/pages/PupilLabs_aBeginnersGuide.html){:target="_blank"}. -->
 
![pupil labs collage]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/publpics/puplabs_collage.png) 

For example, in a recent pilot study, we asked whether the eye movement patterns of pianists performing from memory are consistent across mutliple performances on different days. Basically, we wanted to know if eye movements become a (subconsciously) rehearsed and stable aspect of the full body memorized musical performance. You can listen to me talk about our prelimary results here!

At the [Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en.html){:target="_blank"}, I, together with [Elke Lange](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/the-institute/people/lange.html){:target="_blank"}, would like to bring mobile eye-tracking into the concert hall ([ArtLab](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/index.php?id=625&L=1){:target="_blank"}). While it may seem odd to use eye-tracking (vision) in a musical (auditory) context, a growing number of laboratory studies have clearly established that sound systematically affects visual processing. However, eye-tracking has yet to be widely adopted in auditory, and more specifically, musical, contexts. Previously, mobile eye-trackers have been used to examine gaze patterns of up to 3 musicians playing together; however, no studies have examined mobile eye-tracking data from multiple audience members at a concert, in addition to the musicians on stage. Such an undertaking would allow for comparisons of:
-	gaze location (what audience members and what musicians are looking at)
-	eye movement dynamics (when, in relation to musical events, and each other, audience members and musicians shift their gaze)
-	blink rate (how often people blink) and blink timing (when people blink)

These measures will allow us to answer a number of questions about how and when music affects ocular dynamics. On a lower level, we can also answer questions about which neural mechanisms may underlie certain aspects of musical processing, as many ocular measures have well established neural substrates. Further, we can pit auditory and visual saliency against each other to answer questions related to cross-modal interactions.

### <a name="WAC"></a>Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC)
I served for three years as the lead Graduate Writing Fellow in the University of California Davis's Writing Across the Curriculum program. In this role, I managed a team of six Graduate Writing Fellows and acted as a liason between graduate fellows and faculty. The WAC fellows hold one-on-one [writing consultations](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/consultations){:target="_blank"} with graduate students and postdocs from any discipline, offer writing [retreats](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/retreats){:target="_blank"} and [workshops](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/workshops){:target="_blank"}, as well as specialized programs such as the [Graduate Certificate in Writing Theory and Practice](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/certificate){:target="_blank"} and the [Writing Partner Program](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/resources/writing-partner-program){:target="_blank"}. I developed the curriculum for the Graduate Certificate in Writing Theory and Practice, along with WAC peers [Tori White and Julia Ribeiro](http://writing.ucdavis.edu/wac/gfw-bios){:target="_blank"}. Our reflections and insights as a graduate writing consultant team have recently been published in Praxis:

Making what we know explicit: Perspectives from graduate writing consultants on supporting graduate writers. *Praxis: A Writing Center Journal, 19*(2). https://www.praxisuwc.com/192-wittstock-et-al. 


I also conducted numerous research projects which were presented at the following conferences: 

> Mikovits, M., Sperber, L., **Fink, L.** & Prebel, J. (2019, March). Writing Fellows as Agents of Transfer: Training in Threshold Concepts to Support Campus-Wide Sites of Writing. *Symposium presented at the College Composition and Communication Convention, Pittsburgh, PA.*  

> **Fink, L.**, Ribeiro, J., & White, V. (2018, March). Transforming graduate writing experiences: A new Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) certificate program. *Symposium presented at the College Composition and Communication Convention, Kansas City, MO.*  

> Bright, A., Singleton, J., **Fink, L.**, & Rodger, K. (2017, March). Cultivating a Rhetorical Consciousness: Supporting Graduate Student Writers Across the Curriculum. *Symposium presented at the College Composition and Communication Convention, Portland, OR.*  

> **Fink, L.** & Rodger, K. (2016, June). Mapping neuroscience through professional writing. *Talk presented at the International Writing Across the Curriculum Conference, Ann Arbor, MI.*

Most recently, we have had an article about our collective knowledge as graduate writing consultants accepted for publication! 

> Wittstock, S., Sperber, L., Kirk, G., McCarty, K., de Sola-Smith, K., Wade, J., Simon, M., **Fink, L.** (2021, in press). Making what we know explicit: Perspectives from graduate writing consultants on supporting graduate writers. *Praxis: A Writing Center Journal.*
