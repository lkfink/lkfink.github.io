### <a name="SOMA"></a>SOMA: Seminar Outreach for Minority Advocacy
SOMA is a collaborative project with [Milagros Copara](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Milagros_Copara){:target="_blank"} to enhance diversity within UC Davis and the neuroscience graduate group. The project was initially funded by a University of California Davis [Diversity Inclusion and Innovation Grant](http://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/campus-diversity/diversity-inclusion/dii/index.html){:target="_blank"} that Lauren and Milagros received.

<!-- **Abstract:**
Despite the enthusiasm of the Neuroscience Graduate Group for increasing diversity, there exists a lack of training and awareness regarding diversity-related issues. Adding to this deficit, few underrepresented minorities are invited to give seminars, creating an illusion among our group that success as a minority is rare - a sentiment counter to our stated goals, as well as the retention of our diverse student population. To enhance the visibility of successful underrepresented minorities in neuroscience and educate our campus community about psychological issues that contribute to continued oppression of minority groups, we plan to organize a speaker series consisting of scientists from underrepresented backgrounds. Half of these speakers will be from cellular or systems neuroscience backgrounds, while the other half will be from social neuroscience, speaking on their research related to the neuroscience of implicit bias, race relations, gender, etc. All invited speakers will be asked to begin their seminar with a description of their journeys in academia as a minority. We hope this opportunity to share personal stories will enhance the awareness of underrepresented stories in academia. Potential invited speakers include Tiffany Ito who studies the neural correlates of prejudice and Ben Barres - a transgender man who speaks about gender bias in academia, as well as the function of neural glial cells. Each seminar will be followed by lunch, allowing students the opportunity to interact with the speaker on a personal level. All talks will be open to the entire campus community; lunches will be reserved for neuroscience graduate students.  -->

**Statement of Problem**
Demographics within neuroscience vastly mismatch the actual distribution of minority communities within the United States population [1]. In a 2011 survey report of 97 U.S. neuroscience graduate programs, only 12% of predoctoral trainees were minorities (African- American, Hispanic-American, Native-American, “Other”) - a statistic that reduces to only 4% of postdoctoral trainees and 5% of tenure track faculty [2]. Increasing the visibility of underrepresented scientists is a critical component to addressing this inequity. Without visibility, the aforementioned unequal distributions are inevitably perpetuated. At UC Davis, there is a marked underrepresentation of individuals belonging to marginalized communities who are invited to communicate their research. Our project provides a platform for scientific researchers to share a diverse set of ideas and perspectives, upholding Goals 3 and 4 of the UC Davis Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. This unique exchange will be further developed through dialogue between our speakers and students in social spaces, like pre- seminar lunches and post-seminar dinners, which will hopefully lead to fruitful professional networks and mentorship opportunities.

**Objectives**
- Enhance the visibility of underrepresented scientists
- Give underrepresented scientists a broader platform to reach the scientific community, especially aspiring young scientists
- Facilitate candid dialogue between underrepresented faculty and students, particularly regarding their journeys in academia
- Establish research connections and possible collaborations between our invited speakers and researchers at UC Davis

**Renewed funding for 2018-19!**
Thanks to the UC Davis neuroscience community's interest in this seminar series, we have been able to secure funding for three seminars in 2018-19! Details are available on the [neuroscience graduate group website](https://neuroscience.ucdavis.edu/seminar-outreach-minority-advocacy-soma){:target="_blank"}.

**Renewed funding for 2019-20**
We are happy to report that this seminar series is now receiving stable financial support through the UC Davis Neuroscience Graduate Group.
